A Password Generator

## Description

This is my third project and I am proud to say that this site is used to generate random passwords for use with any account. The user can select character length and what kind of character to include in their password. This solves the need of try to create a unique password yourself. I learned a lot about JS and what it can do. I also learned how to troubleshoot problems and bugs you might run in to.
